        qeb (she/they) is a rising junior cs major at harvey mudd college. college is fun even though there are too many psets. it's great for learning because she doesn't quite know what to do career-wise yet! qeb also likes working on cool things and picking up new skills! that's why this project was born out of a desire to learn more about web design.

        qeb has lived in the san gabriel valley within southern california for most of her life. qeb likes friends, food, and fun. usually this means getting food = fun, but she also enjoys watching movies and tv shows during her downtime.
