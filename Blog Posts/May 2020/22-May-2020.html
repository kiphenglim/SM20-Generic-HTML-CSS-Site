      welcome to the start of it all. what started as a way for me to learn about web dev using html and css turned into a full on blog. oops.
    </p>

    <p>
      as of writing this right now, i still don't quite know if it will be published anywhere on the interwebs. after all, i don't exactly have anything important to say, and i sure as hell cannot think of anyone that actually wants to read this. but as far as pandemic activities go, this one is not so bad i guess.

      you will notice that i don't really like capitals. it is mostly a holdover of my texting/twitter personality, so when i Capitalise something you will know it is actually important in some way. a weird quirk that you will quickly get used to; all my friends have after all.

      what will this blog be about? who knows. themes are hard. there might be a spot of mental health discussion here, a smidge of computer programming stuff there, a smattering of politics hidden in some corner. i definitely do not expect any type of unity or organisation, but i may one day implement some sort of tagging system. again, i am not expecting anyone to actually be reading this, so if you are, congrats for betraying my extremely low expectations.
