      <p>
        Let me be clear: I am not black, nor do I presume to speak over black
        people. But these issues have been raised by black individuals for a
        long time, and as a person with privilege, it is my duty to amplify
        their voices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last week has been exceedingly stressful for many people of colour.
        For people of colour, the ongoing reality of police brutality has
        overflowed into anger, sadness, and grief.
      </p>

      <p>
        The black community is quite familiar with the usual PR tactics that
        many companies engage in for nothing more than superficial optics. Queer
        people have long commented on the fact that companies often change their
        logos to rainbow or sell pride merch, profiting off people's identities
        without making any institutional changes that actually support members
        of the community. They are mostly silent this year due to the absence of
        Pride and a more urgent issue affecting the black community. Instead,
        companies have been posting statements supporting black people and
        posting black squares rather than advocating or amplifying the needs of
        black individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        I cannot speak for other industries, but the tech sector is severely
        lacking in minority representation. The majority of employees are White
        or Asian males, even at the largest and most resource rich companies. A
        quick glance at Google's 2020 Diversity Annual Report shows:
      </p>

      <table class="table text-light">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Race/Ethnicity (US)</th>
            <th scope="col">% Representation in Workforce</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody class="text-align-center">
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Asian</th>
            <td>41.9%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Black</th>
            <td>3.7%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Latinx</th>
            <td>5.9%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Native American</th>
            <td>0.8%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">White</th>
            <td>51.7%</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Leadership statistics are even worse. To Google's credit, they
        <i>are</i> making their statistics easily accessible on the web. Plus,
        Google is only the industry end of a long education pipeline that has
        been failing its Black and Latinx students for a very long time. The
        trends of representation at Google are echoed throughout many a
        university's software engineering program and especially in College
        Board's AP Computer Science exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even so, it's not enough to post a #blackouttuesday square on Instagram
        or send a bland statement email to users. Companies should be following
        through on their words: financially support black-run organisations,
        step up hiring of people of colour, and provide resources to black
        employees.

        Signing off for now.
