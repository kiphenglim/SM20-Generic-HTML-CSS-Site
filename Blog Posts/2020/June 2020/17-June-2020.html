      <h2>
        Life right now is all webdev :)
      </h2>

      <p>
        A couple weeks ago, I watched a satirical TikTok (yes, <it> that TikTok</it>) that described a day in the life of a software engineer. In addition to the typing competition warmup and the two Soylent breaks, the TikTok poked fun at the concepts of "work code" and "fun code". Guilty as charged. I didn't realise just how much I was agreeing to this summer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I figured that my website was going to be some small prototype that would stay completely local. But then I realised how easy it was to actually get a domain, so I caved in and put it up. My friends and I were excited to be able to see our portfolio websites and swap design tips. I am still learning a lot about web design - every single one of my web pages is currently a standalone html page. Downsides include copy and pasting code, lack of modularisation, etc. On the upside, nobody can attack my databases and perform a SQL injection (since I have no databases).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the few weeks before my summer job started, I felt like my website was not taking up enough of my extremely free time. After all, going from sixteen hour schedules to no schedules at all felt like I was sitting around with too much free time and little to do with it. So with great enthusiasm (and much, much later, some trepidation), I agreed to join a team composed of my closest college friends and some others to make a task manager app using React Native. Three hours a week? That's nothing compared to a normal nine to five, I thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there's my actual job, which is not super high paying but with so much potential for personal growth and learning. I am very lucky to be working with a professor at Mudd to maintain web servers housing important scientific data. Personally, the contents of the data isn't so exciting. They're memory traces. The more interesting facet of the project (for me) is the extremely robust code base. The entire project revolves around maintaining and improving a website built on Ruby on Rails, and having run for around a decade or so, it's not a trivial system that can be built by a single person in a summer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Spoiler alert, full-time jobs take up all your time. Or at the very least, all of your motivation for the day. I am in a position of privilege to be supported by my parents and do not need to take on full-time or even part-time jobs to sustain my daily existence. But I doubt my ability to maintain two full-time or multiple part-time jobs to stay afloat. I very much respect those who do. Anyway, I realised that it's pretty difficult for me to open the code editor again after dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the ways I can think of to characterise how overwhelming this summer is feeling is the number of languages I am attempting to learn in the last month. I started with HTML and CSS, which granted did not register in my head as actual programming languages but according to Wikipedia are languages of a sort. I was hoping to avoid Javascript until I was fully familiar with the first two, but then it was unavoidable when I started working with React and React Native, which are both JS libraries. A bit of JS comfort came in handy when I was working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails to modify some of the embedded scripts. Most of our data lives in a database, so I am also getting familiar with SQL (or more specifically, MySQL). 
      </p>

      <p>
        So it seems that for the foreseeable future, a lot of my coding time will be spent on web development projects. I don't mind, actually, I quite like web dev; it gets into my love of designing and working with practical applications. :)
      </p>

      <p>
        Signing off for now.
      </p>
